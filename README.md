# Driving Ball

Driving ball is the very first game I developed using unity. Its a simple game that has a rolling ball and the player can control the ball using buttons. The ball has initial health of 100 and the heath reduces every time the ball collides with any obstacles. The player looses the game if the ball falls below the ground or the health is less than 0.
